# Deep-Learning-in-R
Deep learning is essentially a neural network with three or more layers mimicking human brain with a complex network of neurons. These neural networks like Artificial Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network etc. attempt to simulate the behavior of the human brain allowing it to "learn & relearn" from large amounts of data.
